### Description

A product knowledge graph requires high quality data to empower various downstream applications, therefore knowledge cleaning and quality control are critical to the success. There are two major lines of research in knowledge graph cleaning. One is to do cleaning leveraging rich textual information of products. The other is to leverage the graph structure to identify erroneous data that results in inconsistency in the graph. In this part, we cover the state-of-the-art cleaning methods based on text and graph, and also highlight some of the contributions towards truth discovery, quality evaluation, among others.
